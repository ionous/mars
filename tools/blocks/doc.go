// Package Blocks, a list of match sets and what to generate
// later entries overrde earlier one ( test from bottom to top )
package blocks

// additional match tests:
// parent cmd, any parent.
// possibly there might be some sort of any parent is tag x type thing.

// step n: if you want create a walker for the script db; nil values for empty datl. but really, consider channels for the hist side -- or an adapter -- so that you can implement a javascript source.

// step z: change match functions into commands.

// ad you might want to add classes: st-token, st-pre, st-post; st-cmd, st-cmd-pre, st-cmd-post; st-prim; st-root

// you may want a "quote filter" -- is that a rule that doesnt stop?

// skips for ParamTypeBlob
